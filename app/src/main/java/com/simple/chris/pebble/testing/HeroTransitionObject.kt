     * This would act as the 'gradientScreenAnimationHero' from activity_main.xml
     *
     * It handles the transition animations between multiple Activities and Fragments
     * and would make more sense to be it's own object that spawns when needed and
     * gets destroyed after completion.
     *
     * A nice addition would be if multiple could be spawned, fixing the visual
     * glitch of it not being visible if multiple animations are trying to play.

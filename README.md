*Notice: I was on the edge of whether I should make this repository Public, but a professor of mine urged me to, so here it is. There are some notices I'd like to bring up:
- The current state of this project is "stuck" between updates. I have since moved on to a newer project, and to continue updating this project with the amount of source code, and with how drastically the Android SDK has changed since the last update, the code is in a non-working state.
- The code is heaviliy ineffecient. This was my 2nd programming project, and A LOT of the code is very "hacky". I've since grown from this way of programming, but I think it serves me good to see how far I've progressed since.

With this in mind, I invite you to take a look at the source code (ideally commits from before the latest commit), and to see how my mind worked years ago. I'd love to show off my newer programming knowledge from my current project, but I'm fairly secretive about the internal working of it.

## Future Updates
I may come back to this project to give it a final update, clean up the code and patch some final issues... but unless I get really bored to where I wish to do that, this project doesn't provide income and never will.
